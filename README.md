Therapy Paw – Online Pet Therapy & Adoption Platform

Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Redux, Bootstrap

Overview:
Therapy Paw is a full-stack web application designed to connect users with certified therapy dogs and provide a seamless platform for pet therapy session booking, adoption, and management. The system supports both user and admin roles, enabling users to browse therapy dogs, schedule sessions, manage carts, and complete secure orders while administrators can manage users, pets, and bookings through a dedicated admin dashboard.

Key Features:

🔐 Authentication: Secure user registration and login using JWT and Redux state management

🐶 Pet Management: Display and manage therapy dogs, including images, descriptions, and pricing

🧾 Booking & Orders: Add to cart, checkout, and manage orders with payment information

👩‍⚕️ Doctor Directory: View and book sessions with certified therapy professionals

🛠️ Admin Dashboard: Manage users, dogs, and orders from a centralized admin panel

💾 Database: MongoDB stores all users, dogs, doctors, and order information

📱 Responsive Design: Built with React Bootstrap for a modern, mobile-friendly interface

Purpose:
Created as part of my Bachelor’s final year thesis, this project demonstrates end-to-end implementation of a real-world MERN stack application integrating CRUD operations, authentication, state management, and dynamic routing.
